# Equations - Defined Variable

The Equations - Defined Variable exercise set provides you with an opportunity to create a variety of algebra equations with the variable defined. Students use the defined variable to calculate the answer. This is a great set of exercises for students just beginning algebra.

Select from the predefined templates, or create your own single variable, one side equations.

Change the instructions text

1\. Select the Instructions Text option in the options pane.

2\. Click in the drop down arrow to display the text editor to customize the text. Text can be typed into the box or pasted from another source.

1\. To select the range of exponents to be used, select the drop-down arrow for the Exponents option in the options pane.

2\. Select the desired exponent values, then click OK to apply the selected values.

Limit negative solutions

This option will limit negative solutions **where possible**. Check the box for Limit Negative Solutions to control for the negative solutions. When unchecked, negative solutions will not be controlled.

Limit fractional solutions

This option will limit fractional solutions **where possible**. Check the box for Limit Fractional Solutions to control for the fractional solutions. When unchecked, fractional solutions will not be controlled.

Select a letter for the variable

To change the letter to represent the variable (v) in the equations, click the drop-down arrow beside the Variable Letter option in the options pane and select one of the listed letters.

Use a dot for multiplication symbol

To use a dot for multiplication rather than the common multiplication symbol, select the check box for the Use Dot for Multiplication option in the options pane.

TIP: If no multiplication symbol is desired, leave out the multiplication symbol when creating a pattern: nv or nd to get 4b or 2.3k instead of 4 x b or 2.3 x k

Enclose negative values in parentheses

Automatically enclose negative values in parentheses to prevent consecutive symbols. For example, y + -5 will become y + (-5). To prevent consecutive symbols, select the check box for the Prevent Consecutive Symbols option in the options pane.
