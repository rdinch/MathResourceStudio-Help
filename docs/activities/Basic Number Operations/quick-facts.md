# Quick Facts

Need basic facts worksheets quickly? Try the Quick Facts exercise set.

Unlike the Basic Facts and Operations exercise set, you can select two or three values to focus on in a worksheet rather than a range of values.

For example, if you want to create a worksheet that focuses on using 2 and 4 for basic multiplication, select only Multiplication from the Operation option. Then for either the First or Second values select just 2 and 4. Finally, select the 1-10 button for the other value. You will now have a set of multiplication questions that use 2 or 4 as one of the factors.
