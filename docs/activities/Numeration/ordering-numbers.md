# Ordering Numbers

The Ordering Numbers exercise set presents students with a set of numbers and has them rewrite the numbers in the correct order.

This is an excellent exercise to reinforce the ordering of integers when first introducing negative numbers. Use the Mixed Grouping option and Low and High ranges of -10 to 10 or -20 to 20.

2\. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

Â· If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

Â· For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2\. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

Set the grouping

Numbers in a Matched column will be in the same place-value grouping (e.g., 321, 495, 613, 101, 755, 238). Numbers in a Mixed column will be from any place-value grouping within the selected range (e.g., 125, 14, -31, 25, 210, -10).

Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1\. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2\. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.

Â· select 2 decimal places and the number will become 2.56

Â· select 4 decimal places and the number will become 0.0256
