# Prime Numbers

Reinforce the concept of prime numbers with the Prime Factors exercise set. Students list the factors for a given number, and then determine whether the number is prime (Yes) or not prime (No).

NOTE: A Prime Number is a number, larger than 1, that can only be divided evenly by itself and 1. Or more specifically: An integer (p) is called a prime number if the only positive integers that divide p are 1 and p itself. If an integer is not a prime number, it is called a composite number.

Change the number of exercises

1. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2. Type in a new number or use the up and down arrows to change the value. You can choose any number from 1 to 200.

Change the number of exercises in a row

1. Select "Exercises per Row" in the options panel.

2. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

- If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

- For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

Show title

Show duplicate warning

When this option is selected, a warning is displayed if there are any duplicate exercises in the exercise set. To hide the duplicate warning, uncheck the Show Duplicate Warning option in the options pane.

Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.
