# Magic Squares

A Magic Square is a square in which all the cells in any row or column add up to the same amount. This applies up and down and diagonally.

The challenge of Magic Squares is to blank out some of the numbers in the square and have the students fill in the blanks. In order to do that they need to find the Magic Number. In the above example, 30 is the Magic Number.

The Magic Squares exercise set randomly generates these squares once you select the base and increment numbers. Once the squares are generated, you can customize the worksheet for your class. Depending on the age and abilities of your class you will want to blank out 2, 3 or more spaces in the square.
