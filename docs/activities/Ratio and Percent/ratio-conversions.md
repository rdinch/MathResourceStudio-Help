Change how the ratio is represented

The option determines whether the ratio is a part-to-part or part-to-whole representation:

Â· Part-to-Part Ratio - A ratio which compares a part of the whole to another part of the whole. For example, the statement â€œThere are 5 apples for every 7 oranges â€ expresses a part-to-part ratio.

Â· Part-to-Whole Ratio - A ratio which compares a part of the whole to the whole. For example, the statement â€œ3 out of 5 crayons are redâ€ expresses a part-to-whole ratio. The statement â€œ2 out of 5 crayons are blueâ€ also expresses a part-to-whole ratio.
