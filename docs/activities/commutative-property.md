Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1\. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2\. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.
