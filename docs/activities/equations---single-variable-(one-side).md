Limit negative solutions

This option will limit negative solutions **where possible**. Check the box for Limit Negative Solutions to control for the negative solutions. When unchecked, negative solutions will not be controlled.

Limit fractional solutions

This option will limit fractional solutions **where possible**. Check the box for Limit Fractional Solutions to control for the fractional solutions. When unchecked, fractional solutions will not be controlled.

Select letters for the variables
