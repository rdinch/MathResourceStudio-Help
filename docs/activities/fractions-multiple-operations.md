# Fractions: Multiple Operations

**<u>Fractions: Multiple Operations</u>**

This is a great exercise set for setting up custom created multiple operations questions that use fractions. You can also include whole numbers from -999 to 999 as part of a custom equation. Patterns can use one format of a fraction for the questions (f1 or f2 - Fraction 1 or Fraction 2), or create questions that include both custom formatted fractions (f1 and f2 - Fraction 1 and Fraction 2).

Change the number of exercises

1\. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2\. Type in a new number or use the up and down arrows to change the value. You can choose any number from 1 to 200.

Change the number of exercises in a row

1\. Select "Exercises per Row" in the options panel.

2\. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

Â· If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

Â· For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

**Numbers**

Set the range for any Numbers (n) used in the equation patterns. The range is -999 to 999.

Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1\. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

**Fraction 1 and Fraction 2**

You can create equation patterns that use just the Fraction 1 format, or just the Fraction 2 format, or both fraction formats in the same equation. Set up the options that control the formats for Fraction 1 and Fraction 2.

Change the denominators

1\. To change the denominators, select the drop-down arrow for the Denominators option in the options pane.

Example: Fractions Addition, if the denominators for Addend 1 are set to 3|6|9 and the denominators for Addend 2 are set to 4|5|10, only the 3|6|9 denominators will be used when Common Denominators is checked.
