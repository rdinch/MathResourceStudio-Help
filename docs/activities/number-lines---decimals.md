# Number Lines - Decimals

**<u>Number Lines - Decimals</u>**

Have your students order a set of decimal numbers by placing them on a number line.

The exercises can be made harder or easier depending on the number of points displayed on the line and how many of those displayed points are numbered.

Change the number of exercises

1\. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2\. Type in a new number or use the up and down arrows to change the value. You can choose any number from 1 to 200.

Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2\. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

Show title

1\. To show the exercise set Title, select the check box for the Show Title option in the options pane.

2\. To hide the exercise set title, deselect the check box.

Show instructions

1\. To show the exercise set Instructions, select the check box for the Show Instructions option in the options pane.

2\. To hide the exercise set instructions, deselect the check box.

Show duplicate warning

When this option is selected, a warning is displayed if there are any duplicate exercises in the exercise set. To hide the duplicate warning, uncheck the Show Duplicate Warning option in the options pane.

Change the decimal places for the placement points

1\. Select the drop-down arrow for the Decimal Places option in the options pane.

2\. Select the desired decimal place values, then click OK to apply the selected values.

Set the number of points to be placed on the lines

Select the number of points and their decimal numbers that will have to be placed on each number line. The number range of these points will be defined by the Number of Displayed Points and the Starting Point

Show or hide the placement points on the lines

To make this exercise set easier check Show Hidden Placement Points. The placement points and answers lines are placed on the number lines so the students only need to decide which decimal to write on each answer line. When unchecked, the students must both place a point mark on the number line and write in the correct decimal number.

Determine how many points are labeled on the line

Select whether to display just the First and Last point numbers of the number lines, or a random number of point numbers. This option does not determine how points will be displayed on each line (this is set by Number of Displayed Points). Displayed Point Values determines only how many of the points will be numbered.

Determine how many points are displayed on the line

Set the number of points that will be displayed on the number lines. These points may be numbered or not numbered depending on what you select for Displayed Point Values. The more points displayed on a number line, the easier the exercise set. Range is from 2 to 11.

Set the start point for the numbers on the lines

1\. To set the low end of the start point range, select the input field for the Start Point Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2\. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Start Point High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: Range is from -9999 to 9999. Use the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

3\. Change the distribution of the values - This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers. To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.
