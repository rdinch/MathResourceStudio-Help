# Roots

**<u>Roots</u>**

Do your students need practice in finding the square root or cube root of numbers? Use the Roots worksheet to quickly provide them with a sheet of questions.

Change the number of exercises

1\. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2\. Type in a new number or use the up and down arrows to change the value. You can choose any number from 1 to 200.

Change the number of exercises in a row

1\. Select "Exercises per Row" in the options panel.

2\. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

Â· If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

Â· For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2\. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

Show title

1\. To show the exercise set Title, select the check box for the Show Title option in the options pane.

2\. To hide the exercise set title, deselect the check box.

Show instructions

1\. To show the exercise set Instructions, select the check box for the Show Instructions option in the options pane.

2\. To hide the exercise set instructions, deselect the check box.

Show the answer bank

1\. To show the answer bank, select the check box for the Show Answer Bank option in the options pane.

2\. To hide the answer bank, deselect the check box.

Show duplicate warning

When this option is selected, a warning is displayed if there are any duplicate exercises in the exercise set. To hide the duplicate warning, uncheck the Show Duplicate Warning option in the options pane.

Show or hide the answer lines

By default, answer lines are shown for each question. If you want to hide them, uncheck the box labeled "Visible" in the options panel. To show them again, just check the box.

Roots

Select the root values to find. Select to have an activity with just a single type of root question, or check off more than one type of root to mix the questions.

Change the root values

1\. To change the root values, select the Roots option in the options pane.

2\. Select the check box beside each of the desired values.

Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1\. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2\. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

NOTES: To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.

Use non fractional solutions

Select the Non Fractional Solutions option to limit the questions to those with answers with no decimal remainders.

1\. To use non fractional solutions, select the check box for the Non Fractional Solutions option in the options pane.

NOTE This is an excellent option to select when first introducing the roots concept to students, but be aware that there are few square and cube roots without remainders between 1 and 100.

Set the number of decimal places to round answers to

1\. To set the number of decimal places to round answers, select the input field for the Round Answers To option in the options pane.

2\. Type a new value in the field. Valid values are 0 to 12.
