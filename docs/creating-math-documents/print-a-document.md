# Print a document

The Print Document window provides a way to print both the worksheet and answer sheet at the same time.

TIP: In the Print Document window is setup to print one worksheet (for the students to work on) and one worksheet key (for marking purposes), and one answer sheet (for the students) and one answer sheet key (for marking purposes). If you don't want a particular worksheet, answer sheet or key to print, set it to zero (0).

Open the print document window and print

The

1. With a math document open, click Print on the ribbon, or use the keyboard combination of Ctrl + P .

2. The Print Document window opens.

3. Make your feature selections and select Print at the top of the window.

NOTE: See for information about setting margins, paper size, and orientation.

Set the number of copies to print

The default is 1 document and 1 key. If Number of Worksheets or Number of Answer Keys is set to zero (0), no math worksheets or no answer keys will be printed.

NOTE: If Regenerate Between Copies is selected for the printing job, only one answer key will be printed for each worksheet printed unless Number of Answer Keys is set to zero (0).

Select a printer

The default printer for the computer is selected when the Print Document window first opens. Select the down arrow to select a different printer/printer driver. If you would like to adjust the properties of a printer before printing, click Printer Properties to open the Printer Properties window for the selected printer.

TIP: You can print to PDF file format if you have PDF creation software installed to your computer. If the computer you are using runs on Windows 10, there is a Microsoft Print to PDF built-in, or programs like Adobe Acrobat, PDF Creator or PDF995 install PDF printer drivers to a computer. PDF printer drivers will appear in the drop down list of available printers in the Print window.

Print all pages or only some pages

By default Print All Pages is selected. Click the down arrow by Print All Pages to select page range options like Print Current Page, Print Custom Range, Print Odd Pages, Print Even Pages. The Print Custom Range setting requires information be entered for Custom Range Pages (i.e. entering from 3 to 5 would tell the program to print only pages 3, 4 and 5 of a multiple page document).

To collate or not to collate the pages

Select Collated for multiple page worksheets to print a complete copy of the document before the first page of the next copy is printed. If you prefer to print all copies of the first page, then all copies of the second page, etc., click the down arrow to select Uncollated.

Regenerate between copies

If you prefer to have each student in your class complete a different math document based on the same settings, select Regenerate Between Copies, and set the Number of Worksheets to 2 or more copies, but leave Number of Answer Keys at 1 to get one answer key for each regenerated math worksheet. Between each print job, the math worksheet will be regenerated to create a new document.
