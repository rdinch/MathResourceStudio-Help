# Add a background picture

The Background feature adds a picture behind a whole page like a watermark. Select Home and locate the Document area of the Home ribbon. Select Background to open the Background window.

Select picture

A picture file can be selected from an available folder on the computer (some clipart has been included with the program), or an image can be copied from another source (i.e. a web page) and pasted into the preview box using Ctrl-V or by right clicking the preview box and selecting Paste Image.

Clear picture

Use the Clear Picture feature to remove the image file from the preview box.

Opacity

The background image can be made lighter or darker by adjusting Opacity. The smaller the number the lighter the image. The range is from 1 to 100.

Visible

Check or uncheck Visible to have the background picture to appear or to be hidden on the document pages.

First page only

Check First Page Only to have the background image show only on the first page of a document. If unchecked, the image will appear on each page of the vocabulary document.

Stretch background

Select from three different sizing settings:

Â- margins - the image stretches out to the margin settings, which can appear beyond the printed area of the page in some cases

Â- printable area - the image appears behind just the printed area of the page

Â- page edges - the image is stretched out to the page edges, but is only possible for prints that have this feature, and in most cases, borderless printing must be set for the printer properties
