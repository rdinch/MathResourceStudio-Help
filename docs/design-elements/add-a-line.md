# Add a line

The Line element inserts a line in the math document. Lines can be used to highlight sections of the math document.

Select Line from the list of Design Elements located on the Home ribbon to insert a line below the currently selected element in the document.

TIP: Do you have the exercise sets in two columns across the page but you would like a line in one column across the page? If so, add a new One Column Section first and then add a Line in the new section.

Change the line color

1. Select the Line Color option in the options pane and press the ellipsis button to display the color selection dialog.

2. Use the color picker to select the preferred color.

3. Click OK to close the dialog and apply the selected color.

Change the line width

1. Click on "Width" in the options panel.

2. Type a number between 0 and 10, or use the up/down arrows to adjust the width of the line.

Adjust the padding

Sets the padding (extra white space) around the element in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1. Select the Padding option in the options pane.

2. Select a side (left, right, top, or bottom) to change the value for that side.

3. Type a new value in the input field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range: 0 to 100.
