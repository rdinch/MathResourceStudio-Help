# Basic Subtraction and Regrouping

Basic Subtraction with Regrouping creates basic subtraction questions where you control regrouping.

By default, all Regrouping options are set to No so none of the questions in the exercise set will require re-grouping, plus only zeros appear in the ones position of each number (this option can be turned off in the options pane under Zeros In).

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.
