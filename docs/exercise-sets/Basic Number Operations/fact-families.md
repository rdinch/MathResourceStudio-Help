# Fact Families

This exercise set reinforces the relationship between adding and subtracting, and between multiplication and division.

Three numbers are provided in the triangle above the blank equations. The numbers must be placed in the boxes to make the equations true.

Example: If 12, 5, 7 are displayed and Addition and Subtraction are selected the following equations could be made - 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 5 = 12, 12 - 5 = 7 and 12 - 7 = 5. This is a fact family.
