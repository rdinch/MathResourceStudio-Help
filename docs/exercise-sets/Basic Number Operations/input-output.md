# Input Output

The Input Output exercise set works well as a pre-algebra tool for basic operations.

The student is shown two sets of numbers in the table. The student must figure out the relationship between the numbers (i.e. add 2, multiply by 6), then solve for the blank values in the table and write the rule for the table in the space below the table.
