# Mixed Basic Operations

With Mixed Basic Operations you can create a random mixture of basic operations equations.

!!! note
    Many of the options available for single operation basic exercises sets are available for Mixed Basic Operations, but not all. In some cases you may want to use the single operation exercise sets.

## Change the number of exercises

1. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

- If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

- For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

## Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

!!! note
    The settings for each operation are listed further down the options pane, but an operation name must be checked in order for that operation to be included in the mix of equations.

## Change the question orientation

Select whether to have the questions appear in vertical or horizontal orientation. To set the question orientation, select the desired orientation option (Vertical or Horizontal) for the Exercise Orientation option in the options pane.

## Addition

### Addend 1 and 2

#### Change the range of values for addition

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

#### Change the distribution of values for addition

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

### Limit Sums

#### Apply sum limits

To limit the sums as defined by the Minimum Sum and Maximum Sum options, select the check box for the Apply Limits option in the options pane.

!!! note
    In some cases, this option may override settings for addends.

!!! tip
    If you would like all questions to add up to 10, set both the Minimum Sum and Maximum Sum to 10.

##### Set the minimum sum

1. To set the minimum sum, select the input field for the Minimum Sum option in the options pane.

2. Type a new value in the field. Valid range is 0 to 99,999.

##### Set the maximum sum

1. To set the maximum sum, select the input field for the Maximum Sum option in the options pane.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.

1. Type a new value in the field. Valid range is 0 to 99,999.

## Subtraction

### Minuend and Subtrahend

#### Change the range of values for subtraction

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

#### Change the distribution of values for subtraction

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

Limit Differences

Apply sum limits

To limit the differences as defined by the Minimum Difference and Maximum Difference options, select the check box for the Apply Limits option in the options pane.

!!! note
    In some cases, this option may override the setting for the Subtrahend to ensure no subtraction question has a difference outside the desired limits.

#### Set the minimum difference for subtraction

1. To set the minimum difference, select the input field for the Minimum Difference option in the options pane.
