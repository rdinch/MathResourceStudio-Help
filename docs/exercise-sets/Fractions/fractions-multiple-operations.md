# Fractions: Multiple Operations

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Under Review</p>

This is a great exercise set for setting up custom created multiple operations questions that use fractions. You can also include whole numbers from -999 to 999 as part of a custom equation. Patterns can use one format of a fraction for the questions (f1 or f2 - Fraction 1 or Fraction 2), or create questions that include both custom formatted fractions (f1 and f2 - Fraction 1 and Fraction 2).

## Change the number of exercises

1. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

2. Type in a new number or use the up and down arrows to change the value. You can choose any number from 1 to 200.

## Change the number of exercises in a row

1. Select "Exercises per Row" in the options panel.

2. Click the down arrow to choose a new number from the list or use Auto.

Notes:

- If you are using the default auto settings, the number of questions per row will change automatically when you adjust the font size or the low/high number ranges.

- For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

## Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

## Show title

1. To show the exercise set Title, select the check box for the Show Title option in the options pane.

2. To hide the exercise set title, deselect the check box.

## Show instructions

1. To show the exercise set Instructions, select the check box for the Show Instructions option in the options pane.

2. To hide the exercise set instructions, deselect the check box.

## Show the answer bank

1. To show the answer bank, select the check box for the Show Answer Bank option in the options pane.

2. To hide the answer bank, deselect the check box.

## Show duplicate warning

When this option is selected, a warning is displayed if there are any duplicate exercises in the exercise set. To hide the duplicate warning, uncheck the Show Duplicate Warning option in the options pane.

Add, edit and select equation patterns

1. Select Edit Patterns in the options pane. An ellipsis button appears. Click the ellipsis button to open the editor.

2. Add, edit, and select the equation patterns and save your changes.

3. Click OK to close the editor and apply the changes to the math document.

## Numbers

Set the range for any Numbers (n) used in the equation patterns. The range is -999 to 999.

## Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

## Fraction 1 and Fraction 2

You can create equation patterns that use just the Fraction 1 format, or just the Fraction 2 format, or both fraction formats in the same equation. Set up the options that control the formats for Fraction 1 and Fraction 2.

## Change the denominators

1. To change the denominators, select the drop-down arrow for the Denominators option in the options pane.

2. Select the desired denominator values.

3. Click OK to apply the selected denominators.

Enforce common denominators

1. To enforce common denominators in each exercise, select the check box for the Common Denominators option in the options pane.

2. To allow mixed denominators in each exercise, deselect the check box for the Common Denominators option in the options pane.

!!! note
    If there are two or more options for Denominators for an exercise set - i.e. Addend 1, Addend 2 - when Common Denominators is checked, only the first Denominators values will be used for the questions. Example: Fractions Addition, if the denominators for Addend 1 are set to 3|6|9 and the denominators for Addend 2 are set to 4|5|10, only the 3|6|9 denominators will be used when Common Denominators is checked.

Enforce lowest terms

1. To enforce lowest terms in each exercise, select the check box for the Lowest Terms option in the options pane.

2. To allow equivalent terms in each exercise, deselect the check box for the Lowest Terms option in the options pane.

## Set the sign for the fractions

Select whether to have only positive fractions, or only negative fractions, or mixed signed fractions for the equations. Click by Positive, Negative or Mixed to make your selection.

## Cardinal Numbers

Allow cardinal numbers

1. To allow cardinal numbers to be used with the fractions, click in the check box by Use Cardinal Numbers in the options pane.

2. To use just fractions with no cardinal numbers, click in the check box to remove the check mark by Use Cardinal Numbers in the options pane.

Change how cardinal numbers are displayed

To change how cardinal numbers are displayed, select a bubble by one of the choices for Display As in the options pane - Mixed Number or Improper Fraction.

## Change the range of values for the cardinal numbers

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

1. To set the high end of the range, select the input field for the Range High option in the options pane and enter a new value to the maximum allowed for that exercise.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

Use dot for multiplication

Determines whether the dot operator is used to denote multiplication rather than the multiplication sign.
