# Volume

Create a wide variety of 3D volume and surface questions for your students using the Volume exercise set.

Select from a variety of 3D shapes, three unit sizes, and options for selecting between decimal and common fractional values for the measurements.

## Change the number of exercises

1. Click on the box labeled "Number of Exercises" in the options panel.

- For word problems exercises sets, you can only choose 1 or 2 exercises per row.

## Change the row spacing

Set the spacing between rows of exercises in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1. Select the input field for the Row Spacing option in the options pane.

2. Type a new value in the field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range is 0 to 300.

## Show title

3D Shapes

Select one or multiple 3D shapes for the questions by clicking in the check box by the shapes you want to use.

Unit Size

Select from three unit sizes: Small (generally to 20), Medium (generally between 10 to 30), or Large (generally between 20 to 99). These are the values displayed on the shapes for calculations. The ranges for each size are relative; the ranges may adjust a little higher or lower depending on the shape and values used for other parts of that shape.

Fractional Values

The values used for the shapes calculations can include decimal or common fractions, or be set to None so that only whole numbers are used.

!!! note
    Triangular prisms will necessarily almost always have fractional values for hypotenuse sides.
