## Choose the scale for the thermometers

Select to work with just Fahrenheit scales, just Celsius scales, or a mixture of both scales.

## Show or hide scales on the thermometers

Each thermometer can display both the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. Choose between showing both scales on the thermometers regardless of the selected Scale or showing just the scale needed for the task. When checked, only the required scale is displayed on each thermometer.

## Set the height of the thermometer

The height of the thermometers can be adjusted. Type a new value in the input field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value; 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm). The range is from 300 to 800.
