# Counting Patterns

The Counting Patterns exercise set provides short counting sequences for students to fill in the missing numbers. The exercises reinforce number positioning and relationships. This is also a great exercise set for introducing the order of negative integers.

    You can customize the text that appears just above the counting pattern boxes. Double-click the text just above the boxes and an Edit Exercise box appears.
