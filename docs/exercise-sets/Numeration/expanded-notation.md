# Expanded Notation

The Expanded Notation exercise set has ten different tasks you can use for a set of questions:

- Standard to Words - numbers are generated randomly, and the student writes the number in words

- Words to Standard - numbers written as words are generated randomly, and the student writes the correct number for each question

- Standard to Expanded - numbers are generated randomly, and the student writes the number in expanded notation form; i.e. 625 is written as 600 + 20 + 5

- Expanded to Standard - numbers in expanded notation format (i.e. 600 + 20 + 5) are generated randomly, and the student writes the correct number for each question

- Standard to Full Expanded - numbers are generated randomly, and the student writes the number in fully expanded notation form; i.e. 426 is written as 4 x 100 + 2 x 10 + 6 x 1

- Full Expanded to Standard - numbers in fully expanded notation format (i.e. 4 x 100 + 2 x 10 + 6 x 1) are generated randomly, and the student writes the correct number for each question

- Standard to Place Value - numbers are generated randomly, and the student writes the number in place value format; i.e. 6 hundreds 2 tens 5 ones

- Place Value to Standard - numbers in place value format (i.e. 6 hundreds 2 tens 5 ones) are generated randomly, and the student writes the correct number for each question

- Standard to Expanded Exponential - numbers are generated randomly, and the student writes the number in expanded exponential notation form; i.e. 5,728 is written as (5 x 10<sup>3</sup>) + (7 x 10<sup>2</sup>) + (2 x 10<sup>1</sup>) + (8 x 10<sup>0</sup>)

- Expanded Exponential to Standard - numbers in expanded exponential notation format - i.e. (5 x 10<sup>3</sup>) + (7 x 10<sup>2</sup>) + (2 x 10<sup>1</sup>) + (8 x 10<sup>0</sup>) - are generated randomly, and the student writes the correct number for each question

## Change the range of values

To achieve values within a set range, set the the high end of the range and the low end of the range.

2. To set the low end of the range, select the input field for the Range Low option in the options pane and enter a new value to the minimum allowed for that exercise.

!!! note
    To locate the range for any particular option, check the definition area at the bottom of the options pane when an option is selected. Some exercises allow negative values to be entered for either the high or low end of the range by using the hyphen as the negative sign, i.e. -10, -999, -1000.

## Change the distribution of values

This feature determines whether the randomly selected numbers for the questions are generated completely at random (normal) or if a weighted selector is used (balanced). The balanced setting ensures that small numbers are given an equal chance of being selected along with larger numbers.

To set the distribution of values, select the desired distribution option (Normal or Balanced) next to the Distribution option in the options pane.
