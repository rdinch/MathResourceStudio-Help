# Secret Trails

Need a fun activity for students to practice their addition and subtraction skills? Try the Secret Trails exercise set.

A square of numbers is generated with start and finish points in circles (the finish point is in the box below the square). The finish point has a total. Students must use either addition or subtraction to find the order of numbers that lead to the total using only vertical or horizontal moves.

BONUS! - The answer key shows only one solution, but there may be other solutions for some puzzles. Challenge your students to locate any additional solutions.
