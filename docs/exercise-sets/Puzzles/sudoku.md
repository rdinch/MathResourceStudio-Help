# Sudoku

Sudoku is a popular and fun puzzle that can be used with math classes to reinforce logic and problem-solving skills.

Each puzzle grid contains 81 cells, divided into 9 blocks made up of 9 cells. The grids are presented with only some cells filled with numbers. To solve the puzzle, each block must contain the numbers 1 through 9. In each block, each number can only appear once in a column, row or block. Then across all blocks, within the larger puzzle, each 9 cell column and 9 cell row can have a number appear just once.
