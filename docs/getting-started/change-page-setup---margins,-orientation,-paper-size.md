# Change page setup - margins, orientation, paper size

The Page Setup dialog provides a way to change the margins, as well as select paper size and page orientation (landscape or portrait).

With a math document open, click Page Setup on the ribbon. The Page Setup dialog opens. Make your feature selections and select OK at the bottom of the dialog. At the top of the dialog is a preview panel that allows you to see the relative effect of each change made to paper size, orientation and margins.

Paper Size

Click the down arrow to view and select the paper size (i.e. Legal, Letter, A3, A4) to be used.

Paper Source

If you use a variety of paper trays, click the down arrow to view and select your preferred paper source.

Orientation

Select between Portrait and Landscape.

Margins

The Margins settings are in inches or millimeters depending on the computer's Regional Settings (found in the computer's Control Panel). The default settings should accommodate most printers. Type in new measurements if you find the printed math document is not centered, or some part of the displayed math document is not printed on the page.
