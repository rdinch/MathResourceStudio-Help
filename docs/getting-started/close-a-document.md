# Close a document

To close a single math document, look to the bottom of the work window for the document's tab. Select the X on the tab to close the document.

Do you have a number of math documents open and want to close them all at one time? Right click any math document tab at the bottom of the work window to display a small Close options menu. Select from the following options:

Â- Close Current - Closes only the top math document; a prompt to save will appear if there are unsaved changes for the document.

Â- Close All - Closes all math documents; a prompt to save will appear if there are unsaved changes for a document.

Â- Close All Except Current - Closes all math documents except the top document; a prompt to save will appear if there are unsaved changes for a document.

Â- Close All Without Saving - Use this feature with care! The selection closes all math documents but there is no prompt to save; if there are unsaved changes for a document, those changes will be lost.
