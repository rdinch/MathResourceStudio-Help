# Create a new document

Are you creating your first worksheet in Math Resource Studio? This is a quick overview for getting started. We also have some introductory video tutorials in the on our website and on our channel.

There are variety of ways to get started with the program. Because design elements and exercise sets can be added, deleted and moved easily (using Cut or Copy and Paste), you are never locked into a single method of designing a math worksheet. The steps below are basic introduction if this is the first time using the program.

1. With Math Resource Studio open, select the New tile on the main start screen.

2. On left side of the main program window is a pane called Exercise Sets. Expand any topic by clicking the greater than sign ( **&gt;** ) beside the topic name. The exercise sets available for that topic will be displayed. Click once on an exercise set to add it to your worksheet.

NOTE: The exercise set is automatically added to a One Column section. See to use a different type of section.

3. When the exercise set questions appear on the page, the set will have a light blue border around the group of questions. The border will not print on your worksheet. The border is an indicator that this is the active element on the page, so changes can be made to the questions to customize them.

4. On the far right side of the program is an options pane; the name of the exercise set is at the top of the pane. These are the options that effect the exercise set that has the light blue border around it. Click on any of the options in that pane to customize the questions. Changes are displayed immediately on the page. Examples:

- Want more questions? Click Number of Exercises in the options pane, and use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the number of questions in the exercise set.

- Want a bigger font for the questions? Click the plus sign ( **+** ) by Exercise Set Display in the options pane. Select the Font option, then click the ellipsis button (has three dots at the bottom of the button) that appears at the far right of the box. When the Make Font changes window appears, make your font, style and size selections then click OK. The font changes will appear on the page immediately.

5. Click the Show|Hide Key icon on the main ribbon - the large red check mark - to display the answers on the page to ensure everything looks as you expect.

6. An Answer Sheet for your worksheet will automatically be created as you create your worksheet. Click on the tab Answer Sheet View to customize the look of the answer sheet. If you do not require an answer sheet and answer sheet key, when opening the Print window you can set answer sheets and answer keys to zero (0) so these sheets won't print.

7. Click Print on the smaller ribbon at the top of the window. In the Print Document window you will see that the program is defaulted to print one worksheet (for the students to work on) and one worksheet key (for marking purposes), and one answer sheet (for the students) and one answer sheet key (for marking purposes). If you don't want a particular document to print, set it to zero (0). Finally, click the Print button to start the printing job.

8. Before closing the math worksheet, ensure it has been if you want to continue editing it or want to print it at a later time.
