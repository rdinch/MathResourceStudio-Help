## Creating Your First Worksheet: the Details

There are a variety of ways to get started with the program. Because design elements and exercise sets can be added, deleted, and moved easily (using Cut, Copy, and Paste), you are never locked into a single method of designing a math worksheet. The steps below are a basic introduction if this is the first time using the program.

1. With Math Resource Studio open, select the New tile on the main start screen, or press `Ctrl+N`.

2. On left side of the main program window is a panel called Exercise Sets. Click the arrow ( > ) by a topic name to display the available exercise sets. Click once on an exercise set to add it to your worksheet.

    !!! note
        By default the exercise set is automatically added to a One Column section. See ***[Add a Section to Document](../getting-started/document_sections/add-a-section-to-the-document.md)*** if you would like to use a different type of section.

3. When the exercise set questions appear on the page, the set will have a light blue border around the group of questions. This border will not print on your worksheet; it is an indicator that this is the active element on the page, so changes can be made to the questions to customize them.

4. On the far right side of the program is an options panel; the name of the exercise set is at the top of the panel. These are the options that effect the exercise set that has the light blue border around it. Click on any of the options in that panel to customize the questions. Changes are displayed immediately on the page. Examples:

   - Want more questions? Click Number of Exercises in the options panel, and use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the number of questions in the exercise set.

   - Want a bigger font for the questions? Click the arrow sign ( > ) next Exercise Set Display to display the available options. Select the Font option, then click the ellipsis button that appears at the far right of the box (...). When the Make Font Changes window appears, your selections then click OK. The font changes will appear on the page immediately.

5. Click the Show|Hide Key icon on the main ribbon - the large red check mark - to display the answers on the page to ensure everything looks as you expect.

6. An Answer Sheet for your worksheet will be automatically created as you build the worksheet. Click the Answer Sheet View tab to customize the look of the answer sheet. If you do not require an answer sheet and key, do not print those sheets (see ***[Print a Document](print-a-document.md)***).

7. Click Print on the smaller ribbon at the top of the window or press `Ctrl+P`. In the Print Document window you will see that the program is defaulted to print one worksheet (for the students to work on) and one worksheet key (for marking purposes), and one answer sheet (for the students) and one answer sheet key (for marking purposes). If you don't want a particular document to print, set it to zero (0). Finally, click the Print button to start the printing job.

8. Before closing the math worksheet, ensure it has been saved if you want to continue editing it or want to print it at a later time. Use the Save or Save As button at the top of the window or press `Ctrl+S`.
