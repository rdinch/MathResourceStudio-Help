# Customize the questions - generate or manual edit

Questions in an exercise set can be customized manually, or you can adjust the options for an exercise set so that the program will generate a variety of questions automatically.

!!! important
    If you select Generate Active Set or Generate All Sets on the ribbon, your manually edited question will be overwritten by new randomly generated questions. Do any manual editing of questions as a last step in creating your math document.

Generate the active exercise set or all exercise sets

1. Click anywhere in an exercise set to make it active (a light blue border will appear around the set of questions).

2. Look to the right of the math document to locate the options pane.

3. Customize the options in this pane to suit your needs. The set of questions in the exercise set will re-generate or refresh as each change is made so you can see immediately how the changes effect the document.

4. Once you have customized the options, on the ribbon click Generate Active Set until you are satisfied with the range of questions that appear. Or click Generate All Sets to re-generate all of the document exercise sets at the same time.

## Manually edit questions

Most exercise sets allow for manual editing of questions. The message "There is no editor for this exercise." will appear if manual editing is not available.

1. To customize a question manually, double-click any number in a question. An Edit Exercise window will open.

2. Edit any of the numbers that are available for editing, then click OK to close the editor and update the question.
