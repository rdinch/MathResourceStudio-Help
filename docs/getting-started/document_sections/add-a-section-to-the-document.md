# Add a section to the document

<p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Under Review</p>

The key purpose of a section is to allow you to mix one-column and two-column layouts within a single math worksheet.

For example, you may want all exercise sets to be in two columns across a page, but titles, lines and text blocks in single columns across the page. By using the various types of sections, this can be accomplished easily.

## Add a section

To add a section:

- Click the down arrow for Sections in Layout on the main ribbon.
  
- Select from One Column,Two Columns (manual), and Two Columns Auto. 

- Multiple sections can be added to a math document. Sections can be deleted, cut, copied, and pasted within the same math document, or pasted to a new math document.

## Active, current, or inactive section

A section can be active, current, or inactive.

- To make a section Active, click in a blank space near the section line on the far left side of the document. An Active section is indicated by a solid dark blue line on the far left side of the document (this line will not print on the document). A section must be active to customize that section's options (the right options panel). The active section is also where design elements or exercise sets will be added.

- A Current section is indicated by a solid pink line on the far left side of the document. A current section is where a design element or exercise set is active within the section (a light blue border indicates the active element or exercise set). In this case, the right side options panel will display the settings for the active element or exercise set, not for the section.

- An Inactive section is indicated by a solid light grey line on the far left side of the document. In this case, neither the section nor any of the section's elements are active.
