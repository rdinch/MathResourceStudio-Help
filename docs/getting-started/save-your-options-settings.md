# Save your options settings

**<u>Save your options settings</u>**

Save options now

The options settings for an exercise set or design item are usually only saved when the document you are working with is closed. If you would like to have your customized option settings for the currently selected exercise set or design item saved right away, select Save Options at the top of the options pane. The saved options will now be the default for that exercise set or design item the next time they are added to any document.

Save options on close

The Save Options on Close feature is located at the top of the options pane for each design element or exercise set. The Save Options on Close feature is checked by default and saves the selected options for exercise sets and design items when a document is closed. The saved options become the default for that exercise set or design item the next time they are added to any document.
