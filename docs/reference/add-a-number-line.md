# Add a number line

The Number Line design element provides students with a graphical representation of number ordering.

Use the design element pre-labeled with numbers as a counting aid. Number Lines can be very helpful for students first learning integers and how negative numbers are ordered. For a worksheet that shows a number line from -10 to 10, enter 20 Units, set Start Point to -10 and enter an Increment of 1.
