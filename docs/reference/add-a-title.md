# Add a title

**<u>Add a title</u>**

The Title design element inserts a title area in the math document. Titles can be used to highlight sections of the math document.

Select Title from the list of Design Elements located on the Home ribbon to insert a title below the currently selected element in the document.

TIP: Do you have the exercise sets in two columns across the page but you would like a title in one column across the page? If so, add a new One Column section first and then add a Title to the new section.
