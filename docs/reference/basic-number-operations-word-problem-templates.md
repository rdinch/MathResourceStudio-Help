Template Tags

A variety of tags are offered to turn a word problem into a template. Each operation has some specific math tags (i.e. multiplication has factors - &lt;f1&gt;, &lt;f2&gt; - and product - &lt;p&gt;); the other tags are similar between the templates (i.e. object - &lt;obj&gt;; male name - &lt;nm1&gt;, &lt;nm2&gt;).
