# Check your spelling

A spell checker feature is available for a variety of text items (i.e. Instructions, Text Block). When the Text Editor window for the item is open, select Spelling on the ribbon to start the spell checker.

See for more details on selecting a spell checker dictionary and for turning on/off auto spell checking.
