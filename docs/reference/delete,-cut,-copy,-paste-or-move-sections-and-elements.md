# Delete, cut, copy, paste or move sections and elements

**<u>Delete, cut, copy, paste or move sections and elements</u>**

After adding a number of elements (i.e. number line, title, exercise sets, picture) to a document, you may find that you want to re-organize the order of the items or remove some elements entirely.

TIP: A copied or cut element or section can be pasted within the same document, or pasted to a different document.

Cut, Copy, Delete, or Move an exercise set or design element

1\. Select the design element or exercise set by clicking on it. A light blue border should appear making it the active element.

2\. Click the Home tab. Look for the Edit or Move sections on the ribbon and select the action you want to take:

Â· Cut - Removes the exercise set or design element from the document and places it on the clipboard (the operating system's memory). You can paste that exercise set or design element in another location on the same document, or paste it to a different open document.

Â· Copy - Copies, but does not remove, the exercise set or design element from the document and places it on the clipboard (the operating system's memory). You can paste that exercise set or design element in another location on the same document, or paste it to a different open document.

Â· Delete - Removes the exercise set or design element from the document BUT does not place that element on the clipboard. If the deletion was done in error, use the Undo command on the Quick Access toolbar (located either just above the ribbon or just below the ribbon).

Â· Move Up or Move Down - These commands move the active element above or below the next closest element just above or just below it. This is a very easy way to re-position an exercise set or design element within a document.

NOTE: If using this command is used with elements in a Two Columns Manual section, the elements cannot move between columns, but only up and down with the column they have been placed. Use cut and paste to move an element between the two manual columns.

TIP: Undo (Ctrl + z) and Redo (Ctrl + y) are available on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you delete or move an item in error, you can undo or redo an action.

Cut, Copy, or Delete a section

Do you have a whole section that needs to be moved? No need to move each exercise set or design element separately. Simply copy the whole section and paste it in a new location.

1\. First select the section you want copy, cut or delete. Click in the blank space to the far left side of the document. The section line will turn dark blue indicating it is now the active section.

2\. Click the Home tab. Look for the Edit area on the ribbon and select the action you want to take:

Â· Cut - Removes the section from the document and places it on the clipboard (the operating system's memory). You can paste that section in another location on the same document, or paste it to a different open document.

Â· Copy - Copies, but does not remove, the section from the document and places it on the clipboard (the operating system's memory). You can paste that section in another location on the same document, or paste it to a different open document.

Â· Delete - Removes the section from the document BUT does not place that section on the clipboard. If the deletion was done in error, use the Undo command on the Quick Access toolbar (located either just above the ribbon or just below the ribbon).

Â· Move Up or Move Down - These commands DO NOT apply to sections.

TIP: Undo (Ctrl + z) and Redo (Ctrl + y) are available on the Quick Access Toolbar. If you delete or move an item in error, you can undo or redo an action.
