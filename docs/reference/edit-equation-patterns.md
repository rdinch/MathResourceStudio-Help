# Edit Equation Patterns

NOTE: Each exercise set that uses the Patterns editor for creating and editing equation patterns has it's own editor, though they all work similarly. The equation patterns cannot be mixed between exercise sets. For example, equation patterns for are very different from .

1. Enter an equation pattern in the Pattern box above the grid. You can use the equation symbols buttons below the Pattern box located below the box, or you can enter equation symbols using the keyboard.

TIP: If you are unsure what each equation symbol button does, hover your mouse over the button to display a tool tip.

2. When the equation pattern is complete, select the green check mark to open a Preview of the equation. A sample problem will appear, giving you an opportunity to ensure the equation pattern appears and performs as you expect. Make any additional edits to the pattern that are needed.

3. Then press the plus sign (+) to add the pattern to the grid.
