# Just the Answers - Answer Block

**<u>Just the Answers - Answer Block</u>**

If all you want is just the answers when marking math questions, add an answer block to the end of your math document. Or add answer blocks throughout a multi-page document if you prefer having answer blocks set up after each unit of a math document.

TIP: Answer Block vs Answer Bank - An Answer Block will display the answers for all questions from the beginning of a document or from a preceding answer block to the added answer block. Answer blocks are used for marking the questions in the document. The Answer Bank for any particular exorcise set is not an answer key to use for marking questions, but a bank of answers in random order that students can use for self-checking their work. For example, if a student calculates the answer to a long division question and that answer is not in the answer bank, that answer isn't correct.

Answer blocks are contained within their own special sections with both Section options and Answer Block options.

**Section Options**

Active, current, or inactive answer block section

An answer block section can be active, current, or inactive.

Â· To make an answer block section Active, click in a blank space near the answer block section line on the far left-hand side of the document.

Â· An Active answer block section is indicated by a solid dark blue line on the far left-hand side of the document (this line will not print on the document). An answer block section must be active to change that answer block section's options.

Â· A Current answer block section is indicated by a solid pink line on the far left side of the document. A current answer block section is where the actual answer block is active within the section (a light blue border indicates an active answer block). In this case, the right-hand side options pane will display the settings for the answer block, not the section.

Â· An Inactive answer block section is indicated by a solid light grey line on the far left-hand side of the document. In this case, neither the section nor the answer block is active.

Change the background color

1\. In the options panel, find and select "Background Color."

1\. Click the three dots (ellipsis) in the color box to open the color picker.

3\. Click "OK" to save your choice and apply the new color.

Begin on new page

Adjust the padding

Sets the padding (extra white space) around the element in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the Padding option in the options pane.

2\. Select a side (left, right, top, or bottom) to change the value for that side.

3\. Type a new value in the input field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range: 0 to 100.
