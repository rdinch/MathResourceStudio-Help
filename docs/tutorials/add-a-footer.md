Text Fields

Customize the text fields

All text fields can be completely customized. Suggested data has been entered. If a field is left blank, a blank space appears on the document. If all Top fields - or all Bottom fields - are left blank the other text fields move up or down to fill in the space. You can also use these special auto content tags for any field:

Â· Date: The tags &lt;d&gt; and &lt;D&gt; can be typed into any of the text fields to have today's date inserted to the field, or add days to the date using this format: &lt;d+2&gt;, &lt;D+5&gt;. Each tag provides a different date format: &lt;d&gt; - results in a date format using just numbers, such as 06/06/2010; &lt;D&gt; - results in a date format that uses the name of the month, such as June 06, 2010.

Â· NOTE: Date formatting is based on the computer's operating system Regional Settings. Date format varies between countries. Your local date formatting from Regional Settings will be used, and it may not match the sample provided above.

Â· Auto Page Numbering: The tag &lt;p&gt; can be typed into any of the text fields to have the appropriate page number appear on each page. And you can use the tag &lt;tp&gt; to display the total number of pages for the document. You can use these tags to show the current page along with the total number of pages. Other characters can also be used along with these tags. Example: \*\*Page &lt;p&gt; of &lt;tp&gt;\*\* will appear as \*\*Page 3 of 27\*\* in the header or footer.

Â· Total Marks: The tag &lt;tm&gt; can be typed into any of the text fields to display the total marks for all exercise sets included in the document. You can use this tag along with other characters. Example: Total Marks - &lt;tm&gt; will appear as Total Marks - 30.

Â· File Name and File Path: Type &lt;f&gt; into any field to display the name of the saved test file in the header or footer. Use &lt;F&gt; to display the full path to the saved file.

Â· Serial Number (SN): Type &lt;sn&gt; to add to the header or footer. Serial numbers are generated automatically and can be adjusted manually from the display bar located just below the document.

Â· Version Number: Enter the tag &lt;v&gt; to add a version number to the header or footer. The version number can be manually updated from the display bar located just below the document.
