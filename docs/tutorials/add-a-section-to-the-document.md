# Add a section to the document

A section has one key purpose: to allow for a mixture of single column and two column sections within one math document.

For example, you may want all exercise sets to be in two columns across a page, but titles, lines and text blocks in single columns across the page. By using the various types of sections, this can be accomplished easily.

Add a section

To add a section, click the down arrow for Sections in Layout on the Home ribbon, and select from , , and . Multiple sections can be added to a math document. Sections can be deleted, cut, copied, and pasted within the same math document or pasted to a new math document.

Active, current, or inactive section

A section can be active, current, or inactive.

Â· To make a section Active, click in a blank space near the section line on the far left-hand side of the document.

Â· An Active section is indicated by a solid dark blue line on the far left-hand side of the document (this line will not print on the document). A section must be active to change that section's options. The active section is also where design elements or exercise sets will be added.

Â· A Current section is indicated by a solid pink line on the far left side of the document. A current section is where a design element or exercise set is active within the section (a light blue border indicates the active element or exercise set). In this case, the right-hand side options pane will display the settings for the active element or exercise set, not the section.

Â· An Inactive section is indicated by a solid light grey line on the far left-hand side of the document. In this case, neither the section nor any of the section's elements and exercise sets are active.
