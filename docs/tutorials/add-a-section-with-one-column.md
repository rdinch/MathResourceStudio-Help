# Add a section with one column

**<u>Add a section with one column</u>**

A One Column Section formats all design elements and exercise sets in one column across the page.

Change the background color

1\. In the options panel, find and select "Background Color."

1\. Click the three dots (ellipsis) in the color box to open the color picker.

2\. Choose the color you like.

3\. Click "OK" to save your choice and apply the new color.

Restart numbering

If you are using document wide question numbering for the math document, the Restart Numbering feature will reset the section numbering back to 1.

Begin on new page

This feature provides a way to force questions and design elements to a new page. This feature can be checked at any time; the section will be forced to the next page whether it is blank or it has design elements or exercise sets added already.

Adjust the padding

Sets the padding (extra white space) around the element in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the Padding option in the options pane.

2\. Select a side (left, right, top, or bottom) to change the value for that side.

3\. Type a new value in the input field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range: 0 to 100.
