# Add a section with two auto-flow columns

**<u>Add a section with two auto-flow columns</u>**

With a Two Columns Auto-Flow section the page is divided into two equal columns across the page. Design elements and exercise sets are placed automatically in the columns allowing for a balanced look.

Column Spacing

Column Spacing the spacing between the two columns. This is measured in 100s of an inch, so a setting of 25 equals 1/4 inch while a setting of 40 equals 1 centimeter. The range is from 0 to 100.

Restart numbering

If you are using document wide question numbering for the math document, the Restart Numbering feature will reset the section numbering back to 1.
