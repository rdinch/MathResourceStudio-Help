# Add a section with two manual columns

**<u>Add a section with two manual columns</u>**

With a Two Columns Manual section the page is divided into two columns across the page.

This type of section allows for the greatest control over the placement of design elements and exercise sets in two columns. Click in a column to make it the active column before inserting a design element or exercise set. An active column is indicated by blue arrows pointing at the column.

Column Spacing

Column Spacing is the spacing between the two columns. This is measured in 100s of an inch, so a setting of 25 equals 1/4 inch while a setting of 40 equals 1 centimeter. The range is from 0 to 100.

Column Width Percent

This option sets the width of the first column as a percentage of the page width less the column spacing. The second column is sized accordingly. Select between 20% and 80%.

Restart numbering

If you are using document wide question numbering for the math document, the Restart Numbering feature will reset the section numbering back to 1.

Begin on new page

This feature provides a way to force questions and design elements to a new page. This feature can be checked at any time; the section will be forced to the next page whether it is blank or it has design elements or exercise sets added already.

Change the background color

1\. In the options panel, find and select "Background Color."

1\. Click the three dots (ellipsis) in the color box to open the color picker.

2\. Choose the color you like.

3\. Click "OK" to save your choice and apply the new color.

Adjust the padding

Sets the padding (extra white space) around the element in 100ths of an inch (25 = 1/4 inch, 40 = 1cm).

1\. Select the Padding option in the options pane.

2\. Select a side (left, right, top, or bottom) to change the value for that side.

3\. Type a new value in the input field or use the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value. Valid range: 0 to 100.
