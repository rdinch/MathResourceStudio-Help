# Custom Questions Editor

The Custom Questions editor provides a way to add, edit and organize custom questions and their answers. Depending on how you like to organize your material, you can build one large collection of custom questions or build a variety of collections that can be selected as needed.

1. With the Custom Questions editor open, enter text and/or a picture in the Question box.

2. Then enter text and/or a picture in the matching Answer box.

3. To add more custom questions, click Add Item on the editor ribbon.

4. Once you have added and edited your questions, use Save or Save As to save the collection and click OK to add the questions to the math document.

NOTES:

- To use a question for an exercise set, ensure the Active indicator by the question is green. Green is active; red is inactive.

- To remove a custom question from the collection, click the red X by a question in the grid. A warning will appear before the question and answer removed as this removal action is final and cannot be undone.
