In the Answer Formula box you will set up the formula for the word problem template using the equation symbols located below the box (you can also enter equation symbols using the keyboard if you prefer).

4. Once the answer formula is complete, you can customize the Answer Template. This template provides a way to customize how the answer is displayed. By default a basic answer tag is provided.

Template tags and answer formula equation symbols

A variety of tags and equation symbols are provided to turn a word problem, answer formula and answer format into a template. If you are unsure what a tag stands for, hover your mouse over the tag to display a tool tip.

The number tags that are placed in the Answer Formula box do not require the number range that is entered in the Question Template box. For example, you may have a number tag in the Question Template box that looks like this - &lt;num1(2:15)&gt;; in the Answer Formula box only the tag &lt;num1&gt; is required for the formula to be set up.

!!! note
    It is possible that as you edit the word problem template you may add too many number tags to the Answer Formula box. You can delete and edit any of the tags in the formula box to ensure they match-up correctly with the word problem.
