# Edit Shopping Items

Add, edit and organize the items you want to use with the exercise sets.

Depending on how you like to organize your material, build one large collection of shopping items or build a variety of themed collections that can be selected as needed.

1. Enter an item in the Singular Item box above the grid. Then add the plural version of the item in the Plural Item box.

2. Next, add a Low Price and High Price for the range of prices to be used with this item. Use the up and down arrows, or highlight the number in the box and type in a new number (there is no need to type the currency symbol, the program automatically updates the formatting).

3. Then press the plus sign (+) to add the item to the grid.

4. To use an item in the shopping problems, ensure the Active box is checked by the item. Check or uncheck Activate All to check or uncheck all rows in the grid at one time.
